# FB-login-with-Codeigniter

A simple Facebook login using Graph API and inegrated with CI.

I have been looking for a project on github which uses Graph api of FB and built on Codeigniter framework.
But I failed to find one,so made my own repo on this. 

Although the login form displays both - 'Login with Twitter' and 'Login with Google', but I have still work to do with those options.
So, initially only Facebook login is available. 

I hope to build more on this repo , in the meantime why not play around with the code and send some PR. 

Happy Coding.
